##### Concepts Learnt: Basics of React and JSX

#### Summary of all the learnings
React is a JS library(not to be mistaken with a framework) used to create interfaces and UI components.Using React for UI makes it cooler.
At any time of the development we use JS at one time or the other. JS is one of the two languages which help us interact with the browser.

We also learnt how JS uses render to display any kind of input. We learnt about JSX(more like Javascript for React). 
We also learnt to use Codepen where without installing we could experiment basic React apps.We implemented Simple Render, Conditional Render and also learnt how JS does the event handling stuffs(we used for the event - button click).
